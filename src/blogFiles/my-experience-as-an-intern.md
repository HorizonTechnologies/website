It was the time when my fifth-semester exams were finished. Like every year this was the time for winter vacations. It was the final year of my college , I had never worked as an Intern before, though I had applied for various Internships available in Internshala.com but didn't get any chance.

I was looking for an Internship in the field of web-development. I had enough experience working with front-end technologies like HTML,CSS, and JS. So I pushed my limits further and started working with NodeJS and ReactJS.This time I was full of commitment and I decided not to sit idle at home during these vacations. So I updated my Internshala profile with what I had acheived , what I had made. I listed some of my front-end projects including a MERN stack application.
Then I again started applying for various internships available. I applied for some work from home and full-time internships. I received a reply from Horizon Technologies and they were impressed by my front-end skills.I had a conversation with Jyoti Mam, she told me about the Internship, it was a work from home Internship, so perfect for me.

Later I had a conversation with Vira Sir, he told me everything and supported me to start my work with the team. They assigned me my first project, it was their official website that needed to be migrated to a Reactive website.
Vira Sir helped me a lot in troubleshooting my problems, also he made me interact with one of professional React Developer which helped me a lot during this project.

Finalizing this post, currently I am working on another project with them and I am sure that you will like the overall design of website.
