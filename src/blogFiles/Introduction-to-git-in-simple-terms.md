Let me start with this. ***[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is one of those technologies which haven't changed in the last 20 years***. It is really rare for a technology to remain that consistent. I have heard engineers saying that git is one of the skills which is reaping success to them for decades.

Are you curious more about what makes git special? How does it help in software development? Take a cup of coffee and read on. (Disclaimer: This is not a "How-to" article of git)

***What's the problem that git was trying to solve?***

For a technology to be rock solid, there should be some good reasons for it to exist right. A program can be written by a developer however software is developed generally by a group of engineers. It means they all need to know what each other is working on and also some way to keep track of their past work.

This quote from [Russ Cox](https://swtch.com/~rsc/) nails it:

```
    Software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers.
```

*Let me give a couple of scenarios to think about:*

1. You want to go back to the state (your code) where it was two weeks ago
2. Two engineers working on similar things on the same code base without stepping on each other's toe

All these can be solved by Git. It is a [version control system](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) (vcs). There are other vcs software such as [mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), [svn](https://subversion.apache.org/). Git gained popularity for a reason (which is outside the scope of this blog). It basically tracks all the changes that you make on your program.

***How to learn git?***

So, now you know what git solves and the importance of it. The next obvious question is how do I learn it? Let me recollect how my first encounter. I came to know about git during my grad school project. I was part of a 3 member team. One of them is a senior who was well experienced in Software development. The very first thing he did was create a git repository for our project. My other team member and I were confused. There started my journey with git and I am still in shock today by the wonders that git can do (after 3 years of using it professionally  in 3 different companies)

I know it sounds cliche, but the best way to learn git is to actually use it every day. Develop a habit such that whatever code/documentation you write always uses git. Even if it doesn't need collaboration with other people, still you can get a lot of benefits.

On the next blog in the [Introduction to git](https://horizontech.dev/blogs/Ravi/Introduction-to-git-in-simple-terms) series, we will see how to use it.
