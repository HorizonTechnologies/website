So before starting this blog , I would like to mention that this blog is beginner friendly . It is for those who have little or no experience in coding.

Do you want to be a developer , like to learn programming but didn't know where and how to start? This is a quick guide for you guys.

Basically in this blog we will talk about how good is to learn HTML and CSS in 2020.Firstly HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is not considered as a programming language. It considered as a structuring / markup language for documents to be displayed over the web. Talking about CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) it provides additional styling to the different elements of markup documents.

So Is it still worthy for a beginner to learn these? "Hell yes". I don't admit that these are complementary to any programming language but you could add them as an additional skill. Actually these are the one of the best tools for UI development. With the use of HTML,CSS and JS one can easily create some mesmerizing user interfaces,animations and many other things.
Even I started my journey as a web-developer by just learning HTML and CSS first and then I moved to Javascript , you can go for Python also.
But I got bonus advantage that learning Javscript made my path so easy. For web developement you can learn NodeJS, ReactJS, AngularJS, GatsbyJS and many many other frameworks of Javascript are there.

For example I use ReactJS which is a great Javascript framework for building web-interfaces where I have to embed my HTML into the code and also need to provide some additional styling to it.
So for me HTML and CSS were worthy to learn , as I learnt about basic stucturing of a webpage and some basic concepts of UI designing.

Also I will encourage every beginner to go through these atleast once.
